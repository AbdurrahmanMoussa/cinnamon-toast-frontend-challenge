# Challenge 2: Filterable List Component

For this challenge, I chose to complete the filterable list component. I felt like this would be the one that would be most challenging and rewarding. I ended up really enjoying the process and working through the bonus features.

## How to run:

- Clone or download the repository.
- Open `index.html` in any web browser.
- Interact with the search bar, category filter, and sort dropdown to see the list update.

## Notes

- Implemented all the **bonus features**:
  - Animations when filtering
  - Sorting by date
  - Alphabetical sorting (A–Z, Z–A)
  - Count of visible results
  - Accessible dropdowns and ARIA roles
- Added additional styling and card hover effects to make the list more engaging and responsive
