# Challenge 2: Filterable List Component

For this challenge, I chose to complete the filterable list component. I ended up really enjoying the process and working through the bonus features.

## How to run:

- Clone or download the repository.
- Open `index.html` in any web browser.
- Interact with the search bar, category filter, and sort dropdown to see the list update.

## Notes

- Implemented the following **bonus features**:
  - Animations when filtering
  - Sorting by date
  - Alphabetical sorting (A–Z, Z–A)
  - Count of visible results
  - Accessible dropdowns and ARIA roles
  - Removable filter chip for category
  - Added tags and ability to filter by tag
- Added additional styling and card hover effects to make the list more engaging and responsive.
